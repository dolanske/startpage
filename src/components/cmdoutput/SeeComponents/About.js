            <h2>Hello there</h2>
            <p>First I'd like to say thanks for getting this far on my little website. As a reward here is some info about me. I am 21 years old, born and raised in Zlin Czech Republic and currently fluctating somewhere between Czech and Finland depending how I wake up in the morning. I am an amateur musician and it's been my lifetime passion. I also make webpages for living. Something about the functinality, optimmisation and making functinal things look nice fascinates. I also really like both flora and fauna and often you will find me during a hike or a day out. If you wanna see some of professinal / personal work, just type <strong>'see projects'</strong> in here!</p>
